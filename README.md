**Logo Smith** is easy and intuitive to use. To run it, open the Logo Smith folder in your terminal, then type `node index.js` or `npm start` and hit `enter`.

<br>
<br>

Next, the Smith will ask you for a text to display on your logo. Think of an acronym for it, 4 characters max, or maybe just a single character/number/symbol.

<br>

Then, you'll choose between circle, triangle and square as your logo shape.

Finally, you may choose a background for your logo. It's optional, but it's perfect for favicons and profile pics!

Once you're done, you'll find your new SVG inside the *your_crafted_svg* folder.
