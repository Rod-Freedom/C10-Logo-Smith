Next, the Reactor will ask you for your repo and user name. Be sure to write an existing GH repo and user name to continue. If you don't have a license, the Reactor will recommend getting one.

Finally, you'll be given the option to include a demo in your README. If you choose to do so, you'll need to place an asset in the `./Atomic_README/assets/` directory and press enter. You'll then receive a confirmation that your README is ready. The file will be generated in the `/Atomic_README` folder.
